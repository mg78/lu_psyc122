At the moment the content represents the “lab materials” for the PSYC122 module in first year. As was the case for PSYC121, they feature tuition of programming with R, building on the skills you developed last term. 1.1 Analysis labs and ‘pre-lab work’ Some parts should be completed before you attend the lab session (watching lectures, reading chapters, pre-lab activities). All the links to the different materials and activities are also in the ‘to-do list’ for the relevant week on Moodle. "],["week-11-correlation.html", "2 Week 11: Correlation 2.1 Lectures 2.2 Reading 2.3 Pre-lab activities 2.4 Lab activities 2.5 Answers", " 2 Week 11: Correlation Written by Margriet Groen (partly adapted from materials developed by the PsyTeachR team a the University of Glasgow) Today we will take a look at correlation as a measure of association between two numerical variables. We will create scatterplots to visualise correlations, we will run a correlation analysis and we will practise interpreting and reporting the results. 2.1 Lectures The lecture material for this week is presented in two parts: Theory Watch this part before you complete the reading and the pre-lab activities. How to Watch this part either after the ‘Theory’ part of after you’ve completed the pre-lab activities 1 to 3. Definitely watch it before you come to your lab session. 2.2 Reading The reading that accompanies the lectures this week and next week is from the free textbook by Miller and Haden. Chapter 10 gives you a brief overview of what correlation and regression are. Chapter 11 introduces correlation in more detail. Both chapters are really short but provide a good basis to understanding correlational analysis. Please note, in Chapter 10 you might encounter some terminology that is unfamiliar to you. It talks about ANOVA, which means Analysis of Variance and about GLM, which means General Linear Model. Having a quick look at Chapter 1 of Miller and Haden also helps with that. 2.3 Pre-lab activities After having watched the lectures on correlation and read the textbook chapters you’ll be in a good position to try these activities. Completing them before you attend your lab session will help you to consolidate your learning and help move through the lab activities more smoothly. 2.3.1 Pre-lab activity 1: Visualing correlations Have a look at this visualisation of correlations by Kristoffer Magnusson. After having read Miller and Haden Chapter 11, use this visualisation page to visually replicate the scatterplots in Figures 11.3 and 11.4 - use a sample of 100. After that, visually replicate the scatterplots in Figure 11.5. Each time you change the correlation, pay attention to the shared variance (the overlap between the two variables) and see how this changes with the changing level of relationship between the two variables. The greater the shared variance, the stronger the relationship. Also, try setting the correlation to r = .5 and then moving a single dot to see how one data point, a potential outlier, can change the stated correlation value between two variables. 2.3.2 Pre-lab activity 2: Guess the correlation Now that you are well versed in interpreting scatterplots (scattergrams) have a go at this online app on guessing the correlation. This is a very basic app that allows you to see how good you are at recognising different correlation strengths from the scatterplots. We would recommend you click the “Track Performance” tab so you can keep an overview of your overall bias to underestimate or overestimate a correlation. Is this all just a bit of fun? Well, yes, because stats is actually fun, and no, because it serves a purpose of helping you determine if the correlations you see in your own data are real, and to help you see if correlations in published research match with what you are being told. As you will have seen from the above examples, one data point can lead to a misleading relationship and even what might be considered a medium to strong relationship may actually have only limited relevance in the real world. One only needs to mention Anscombe’s Quartet to be reminded of the importance of visualising your data, which leads us to the final pre-lab activity for this week. 2.3.3 Pre-lab activity 3: Anscombe’s quartet Anscombe (1973) showed that four sets of bivariate data (X, Y) that have the exact same means, medians, and relationships can look very different when plotted. You can read more about this here. All in this is a clear example of why you should visualise your data and not to rely on just the numbers. 2.3.4 Pre-lab activity 4: Getting ready for the lab class 2.3.4.1 Remind yourself of the basics of how to work with RStudio. You might want to re-watch some of the videos John and Tom provided in PSYC121: Video on how to upload a zip file and import data (3.5 mins) Video on basic operations in RStudio (8 mins) Video on using scripts and using the console (3 mins) 2.3.4.2 Create a folder and a Project for Week 11. Click here for the instructions from Week 6 of PSYC121 if you are unsure. 2.3.4.3 Get your files ready Download the 122_week11_forStudents.zip file and upload it into the new folder in RStudio Server you created at the previous step. If you need them, here are the instructions from Week 2 of PSYC121. 2.4 Lab activities In this lab, you’ll gain understanding of and practice with: constructing and interpreting scatterplots running correlation analysis and interpret the results reporting the results in APA format constructing a correlation matrix in APA format when and why to apply correlation analysis to answers questions in psychological science 2.4.1 Lab activity 1: Interpreting correlation 2.4.1.1 Question 1 Below are scatterplots that show the relationship between ‘how much you know about correlation and how attractive you appear to members of the opposite (&amp;/or same) sex’. Choose the type of correlation (strength and direction) displayed in each graph using one of the following: Perfect positive correlation Perfect negative correlation Strong positive correlation Strong negative correlation Moderate positive correlation Moderate negative correlation Null correlation Figure A Figure B Figure C Figure D 2.4.1.2 Question 2 Suppose it was observed that there is a correlation of r = -.81 between a driver’s age and the cost of car insurance. This correlation would mean that, in general, older people pay more for car insurance. TRUE or FALSE? Explain why. Note: explain your chosen answer based on the statistic given, not on why you think the correlation may or may note make ‘logical’ sense). 2.4.1.3 Question 3 Suppose that there is a correlation of r = .87 between the length of time a person is in prison and the amount of aggression the person displays on a psychological inventory administered at release. This means that spending a longer amount of time in prison causes people to become more aggressive. TRUE or FALSE? Explain why. 2.4.1.4 Question 4 A significant correlation was found between having great hair and performance in correlation labs. The correlation coefficient was .7. How much variance in correlation lab performance can the ‘greatness’ of your hair explain? 51% 70% 49% 30% Who cares I’ve got great hair. What was the reason for your answer? What is this ‘new coefficient’ called? 2.4.2 Lab activity 2: Visualising, calculating and reporting correlations Going back to the data discussed in Chapter 11 of Miller &amp; Haden, you’ll remember it contains data from 25 8-year-old children on: a standardised test of reading ability (Abil) intelligence (IQ) the number of minutes per week spent reading in the home (Home) and the number of minutes per week spent watching TV (TV) In the video on ‘How to conduct correlation analysis using R’ we looked at the correlation between reading ability and intelligence. Now, let’s look at the correlation between number of minutes per week spent reading in the home and watching TV. The folder you were asked to download under ‘Pre-lab activity 4: Getting ready for the lab class’ contains the datafile (“MillerHadenData.csv”) as well as the R-script from the ‘How to …’ video (122_wk11_howtoExample.R) that you can use here and adapt. Load the ‘broom’ and the ‘tidyverse’ libraries by running the first two lines of code. Read in the data. You should now see an object with 25 observations and 5 variables in the ‘Environment’. Click on it to view it. Construct a scatterplot of the relationship between ‘Home’ and ‘TV’. What can you tell from the scatterplot about the direction of the relationship? Conduct the correlation analysis. What is the correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r)? What is the p value? Is the correlation significant at the p &lt; .05 level? What are the degrees of freedom you need to report? How much variance in ‘time spent reading’ can be accounted for by ‘time spent watching TV’? (Hint: you can use the Console in RStudio as a calculator.) Write a few sentences in which you report this result, following APA guidelines. 2.4.3 Lab activity 3: More correlations Researchers were interested in the relationship between hazardous alcohol use and impulsivity (making unplanned, rapid decisions without thinking or ‘acting on a whim’). To investigate the relationship, 20 participants completed both the alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT; Saunders, Aasland, Babor, de la Fuente, &amp; Grant, 1993) and the Barratt’s Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) (Patton, Stanford, &amp; Barratt, 1995). The datafile (“alcoholUse_Impulsivity.csv”) is in the folder you were asked to download under ‘Pre-lab activity 4: Getting ready for the lab class’. Again, the R-script from the ‘How to …’ video (122_wk11_howtoExample.R) is useful here. Load the ‘broom’ and the ‘tidyverse’ libraries by running the first two lines of code. Read in the data. You should now see an object containing the data in the ‘Environment’. How many variables does it have? Construct a scatterplot of the relationship between ‘Hazardous Alcohol Use’ and ‘Impulsivity’. What can you tell from the scatterplot about the direction of the relationship? Conduct the correlation analysis. What is the correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r)? What is the p value? Is the correlation significant at the p &lt; .05 level? What are the degrees of freedom you need to report? How much variance in ‘impulsivity’ can be accounted for by ‘hazardous alcohol use’? (Hint: you can use the Console in RStudio as a calculator.) Construct a correlation matrix to display the correlation coefficient in a table. Give three logically possible directions of causality, indicating for each direction whether it is a plausible explanation in light of the variables involved (and why). No, this is not a trick question -—I know that correlation does not infer causation, but think critically! New studies/ideas are constructed by thinking what the previous study doesn’t tell us about what could be happening with the variables of interest. Job completed — Well done! 2.5 Answers When you have completed all of the lab content, you may want to check your answers with our completed version of the script for this week. Remember, looking at this script (studying/revising it) does not replace the process of working through the lab activities, trying them out for yourself, getting stuck, asking questions, finding solutions, adding your own comments, etc. Actively engaging with the material is the way to learn these analysis skills, not by looking at someone else’s completed code… 2.5.1 Lab activity 1: Interpreting correlation Scatterplots strong positive correlation null correlation moderate positive correlation perfect negative correlation FALSE Explanation: The correlation coefficient is negative and therefore infers a negative correlation. As such, older people pay less for car insurance: as age increases, car insurance costs decrease. FALSE Explanation: This is a bit of trick question as it has the sneaky ‘cause’ word in. The correlation coefficient is a positive number, suggesting a positive relationship between length of time in prison and aggression. However, causation cannot be inferred from correlation and therefore we cannot know whether time spent in prison CAUSES aggression, and rather we suggest a relationship between the two that as length of time in prison increases, aggression increases. c 49% The ‘coefficient of determination’ or ‘R-squared’ tells us the proportion or variance in one variable that can be predicted if we know the other variable. We can determine this by squaring the r. Therefore, .72 = .49, R2 = .49. 2.5.2 Lab activity 2: Constructing scatterplots and calculating correlations You can download the R-script that contains the code to complete lab activities 2 and 3 here: 122_wk11_labActivities2_3.R. See R script See R script See R script What can you tell from the scatterplot about the direction of the relationship? There is a negative association between ‘Home’ and ‘TV’. This means that the longer a child spends watching TV, the shorter they will read at home. Conduct the correlation analysis. See R script What is the correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r)? r = -.65 What is the p value? p &lt; .001 Is the correlation significant at the p &lt; .05 level? Yes, because the p-value is smaller than .005 What are the degrees of freedom you need to report? 23 How much variance in ‘time spent reading’ can be accounted for by ‘time spent watching TV’? 42% Write a few sentences in which you report this result, following APA guidelines. Something along the lines of: A Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between time spent reading at home and time spent watching TV at home. There was a significant negative correlation, r(23) = -.65, p &lt; .001. As time spent watching TV at home increased, time spent reading at home decreased. 2.5.3 Lab activity 3: More correlations See R script How many variables does it have? 3 See R script What can you tell from the scatterplot about the direction of the relationship? There is a positive association between ‘hazardous alcohol use’ and ‘impulsivity’. This means that as a participant’s score on ‘hazardous alcohol use’ goes up, their score on ‘impulsivity’ also goes up. See R script What is the correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r)? r = .54 What is the p value? p = .014 Is the correlation significant at the p &lt; .05 level? Yes What are the degrees of freedom you need to report? 18 How much variance in ‘impulsivity’ can be accounted for by ‘hazardous alcohol use’? (Hint: you can use the Console in RStudio as a calculator.) 29% Construct a correlation matrix to display the correlation coefficient in a table. 12. Give three logically possible directions of causality, indicating for each direction whether it is a plausible explanation in light of the variables involved (and why). No, this is not a trick question -—I know that correlation does not infer causation, but think critically! New studies/ideas are constructed by thinking what the previous study doesn’t tell us about what could be happening with the variables of interest. Just really looking for reasoning here. Examples: Being more impulsive may make people consume more alcohol. Consuming more alcohol may make people more impulsive. An outgoing personality might influence both your level of impulsivity and you are more likely to be socialising in the pub and consuming alcohol. So the same ‘third factor’ may influence both our variables of interest. "],["week-12-correlation-2.html", "3 Week 12: Correlation 2 3.1 Lectures 3.2 Reading 3.3 Pre-lab activities 3.4 Lab activities 3.5 Answers", " 3 Week 12: Correlation 2 Written by Margriet Groen (partly adapted from materials developed by the PsyTeachR team a the University of Glasgow) Today we will continue a look at correlation as a measure of association between two numerical variables. We will review assumptions associated with correlation, discuss some issues important to be aware of when interpreting correlation results and finally, we’ll talk about intercorrelation. 3.1 Lectures The lecture material for this week is presented in two parts: Correlation – Assumption, issues and intercorrelation – Theory Correlation – Assumption, issues and intercorrelation – How to 3.2 Reading The reading that accompanies the lectures this week is (the same as last’s week) from the free textbook by Miller and Haden. Chapter 10 gives you a brief overview of what correlation and regression are. Chapter 11 introduces correlation in more detail. Both chapters are really short but provide a good basis to understanding correlational analysis. Please note, in Chapter 10 you might encounter some terminology that is unfamiliar to you. It talks about ANOVA, which means Analysis of Variance and about GLM, which means General Linear Model. Having a quick look at Chapter 1 of Miller and Haden also helps with that. 3.3 Pre-lab activities After having watched the lectures on correlation and read the textbook chapters you’ll be in a good position to try these activities. Completing them before you attend your lab session will help you to consolidate your learning and help move through the lab activities more smoothly. 3.3.1 Pre-lab activity 1: Online interactive tutorial to practise your data-wrangling skills Data comes in lots of different formats. One of the most common formats is that of a two-dimensional table (the two dimensions being rows and columns). Usually, each row stands for a separate observation (e.g. a participant), and each column stands for a different variable (e.g. a response, category, or group). A key benefit of tabular data is that it allows you to store different types of data-numerical measurements, alphanumeric labels, categorical descriptors-all in one place. It may surprise you to learn that scientists actually spend far more of time cleaning and preparing their data than they spend actually analysing it. This means completing tasks such as cleaning up bad values, changing the structure of tables, merging information stored in separate tables, reducing the data down to a subset of observations, and producing data summaries. Some have estimated that up to 80% of time spent on data analysis involves such data preparation tasks (Dasu &amp; Johnson, 2003)! Many people seem to operate under the assumption that the only option for data cleaning is the painstaking and time-consuming cutting and pasting of data within a spreadsheet program like Excel. We have witnessed students and colleagues waste days, weeks, and even months manually transforming their data in Excel, cutting, copying, and pasting data. Fixing up your data by hand is not only a terrible use of your time, but it is error-prone and not reproducible. Additionally, in this age where we can easily collect massive datasets online, you will not be able to organise, clean, and prepare these by hand. In short, you will not thrive as a psychologist if you do not learn some key data wrangling skills. Although every dataset presents unique challenges, there are some systematic principles you should follow that will make your analyses easier, less error-prone, more efficient, and more reproducible. In the online tutorial, you will see how data science skills will allow you to efficiently get answers to nearly any question you might want to ask about your data. By learning how to properly make your computer do the hard and boring work for you, you can focus on the bigger issues. You’ll be practising the select(), filter(), mutate(), arrange(), group_by() and summarise() functions from the dplyr package. You’ve used these functions before, but if you’d like to quickly remind yourself what they do, watch the video (~10 min) on Data wrangling: dplyr and pipes. As the title suggests, I also explain in the video what a ‘pipe’ (this thing: %&gt;%) is and you’ll be practising with that as well. If you’re ready to begin, go to the tutorial linked to below. There is no need to install or download anything. Each tutorial has everything you need to write and run R code, right in the tutorial. Working with Tibbles Practise how to extract values form a table, subset tables, calculate summary statistics, and derive new variables. 3.3.2 Pre-lab activity 2: Getting ready for the lab class 3.3.2.1 Get your files ready Download the 122_week12_forStudents.zip file and upload it into the new folder in RStudio Server you created (see last week’s Pre-lab activity 4 for instructions on how to do that. 3.4 Lab activities In this lab, you’ll gain understanding of and practice with: constructing and interpreting histograms and qq-plots constructing and interpreting a matrix of scatterplots running intercorrelation analysis and interpret the results correct for multiple comparisons when running intercorrelation analysis constructing a correlation matrix in APA format when and why to apply correlation analysis to answers questions in psychological science 3.4.1 Lab activity 1: Assumptions of Correlation Analysis 3.4.1.1 Question 1 Correlation would be an appropriate form on analysis for researchers interested in the relationship between a. Dog (breed) and height (cm) of owner b. Speed of swimming (mph) and area of tank (cm) c. Number of cows sitting and rain fall (mm) d. Total llama saliva (ml) expelled and gender of visitors e. b and d f. b and c 3.4.1.2 Question 2 When would you use Spearman’s rho analysis instead of Pearson’s r? a. When there are clear outliers in the data b. When the data is not normally distributed c. When the relationship between X and Y is curvilinear d. a and b 3.4.1.3 Question 3 Using the histograms and qq-plots below, which of these variables satisfies the normality assumption? Explain your answers. Histogram non-words QQ-plot non-words Histogram words QQ-plot words Histogram vocabulary QQ-plot non-words 3.4.1.4 Question 4 Why should correlation analysis not be conducted on variables with a curvilinear relationship? 3.4.2 Lab activity 2: Attitudes towards vaping Great work so far! Now we really want to see what you can do yourself. In this activity we’ll use real data on implicit and explicit attitudes towards vaping. You’ll need the data file VapingData.csv and the R-script 122_wk12_labAct2_template.R that you downloaded when completing Pre-lab activity 2. 3.4.2.1 Background Explicit attitudes were measured via a questionnaire where higher scores indicated a positive attitude towards vaping (VapingQuestionaireScore). Implicit attitudes were measured through an Implicit Association Test (IAT) using images of Vaping and Kitchen utensils and associating them with positive and negative words. The IAT works on the principal that associations that go together (that are congruent, e.g. warm and sun) should be quicker to respond to than associations that do not go together (that are incongruent, e.g. warm and ice). You can read up more on the procedure on the Noba Project which has a good description of the procedure under the section “Subtle/Nonsconscious Research Methods”. For this exercise, you need to know that “Block 3” in the experiment tested reaction times and accuracy towards congruent associations, pairing positive words with Kitchen utensils and negative words with Vaping. “Block 5” in the experiment tested reaction times and accuracy towards incongruent associations, pairing positive words with Vaping and negative words with Kitchen Utensils. As such, if reaction times were longer in Block 5 than in Block 3 then people are considered to hold the view that Vaping is negative (i.e. congruent associations are quicker than incongruent associations). However, if reaction times were quicker in Block 5 than in Block 3 then people are considered to hold the view that Vaping is positive (i.e. incongruent associations were quicker than congruent associations). The difference between reaction times in Block5 and Block3 is called the participants’ IAT score. 3.4.2.2 Step 0: Clean your environment Before you do anything else, when starting a new analysis, it is a good idea to empty the R environment. This prevents objects and variables from previous analyses interfering with the current one. You can do this by clicking on the broom icon at the top of the environment window, or you can use the code below. TASK: Use the code snippet below to clear the environment. TIP: If you hover your mouse over the box that includes the code snippet, a ‘copy to clipboard’ icon will appear in the top right corner of the box. Click that to copy the code. Now you can easily paste it into your script. rm(list=ls()) 3.4.2.3 Step 1: Set your working directory Now, make sure your working directory is set to the folder in which you have stored the data file (VapingData.csv). TASK: Use the code snippet below to check what you working directory is currently set to. This is the folder that R will use to look for files. Is the file path that is written to the Console after you run the code snippet the one that contains the data file? You can check by nativating to the path you can see in the Console in the ‘Files’ pane on the right. Does it contain the data file (‘VapingData.csv’)? getwd() If your working directory is not set to the folder that contains the data file, navigate to folder that contains the data file in the ‘Files’ pane, click ‘More’ and then on ‘Set as working directory’. 3.4.2.4 Step 2: Load packages Before we can get started we need to tell R which libraries to use. For this analysis we’ll need broom, car, Hmisc, lsr and tidyverse. TASK: Load the relevant libraries. HINT: Use the library() function. 3.4.2.5 Step 3: Read in the data The data file we’ll be working with is VapingData.csv TASK: Read in the data file (using the read_csv() function) and store it in an object called dat. Have a look at the layout of the data and familiarise yourself with it. You have 8 columns. Reaction times and Accuracy scores for Blocks 3 and 5 as well as the Explicit Vaping Questionnaire scores, Sex and Age, for each participant. QUESTION 1: For how many participants do we have data? 3.4.2.6 Step 4: Data wrangling The data are not in a shape yet that we can actually use for our analysis. We’ll have to do some ’data wrangling to knock them into shape. We need to take the following into account: Accuracy was calculated as proportion and as such can’t go above 1.Participants entered their own data so some might have made a mistake. Remove participants who had an accuracy greater than 1 in either Block 3 or Block 5 as we are unclear on the accuracy of these values. We also only want participants who were paying attention so best remove anybody whose average accuracy score across Blocks 3 and 5 was less than 80%. Note - this value is arbitrary and if you wanted, in your own experiment, you could use a more relaxed or strict cut-off based on other studies or guidance. Note that these decisions should be set out at the start of your research as part of your pre-registration or as part of your Registered Report. Finally, in this instance, remember, the values are in proportions not percentages (so 80% will be .8). Now that we have removed data points that were the result of data entry mistakes or came participants who didn’t pay attention during the task, we create an IAT score for participants by subtracting Block 3 reaction times (RT) from Block 5 reaction times (IAT_BLOCK5_RT - IAT_BLOCK3_RT). TASK: Look closely at each line of code below and check you understand what it does. Copy the code to your script and for each line add a comment to describe what it does. dat &lt;- dat %&gt;% filter(IAT_BLOCK3_Acc &lt; 1) %&gt;% filter(IAT_BLOCK5_Acc &lt; 1) %&gt;% mutate(IAT_ACC = (IAT_BLOCK3_Acc + IAT_BLOCK5_Acc)/2) %&gt;% filter(IAT_ACC &gt; .8) %&gt;% mutate(IAT_RT = IAT_BLOCK5_RT - IAT_BLOCK3_RT) QUESTION 2: For how many participants do we have data now that we have cleaned them up? QUESTION 3: Use the information in the background description to understand how the scores relate to attitudes. What does a positive IAT_RT score reflect? What does a negative IAT_RT score reflect? What does a higher score on the ‘VapingQuestionnaireScore’ mean? 3.4.2.7 Step 5: Calculating descriptive statistics Now that we have the variables that we need and the data cleaned up, we will create a descriptives summary of the number of people, and the means for the IAT and Vaping Questionnaire Score. TASK: Look closely at each line of code below and check you understand what it does. Copy the code to your script and for each line add a comment to describe what it does. descriptives &lt;- dat %&gt;% summarise(n = n(), mean_IAT_ACC = mean(IAT_ACC), mean_IAT_RT = mean(IAT_RT), mean_VPQ = mean(VapingQuestionnaireScore, na.rm = TRUE)) QUESTION 4: Why might these averages be useful? Why are averages not always useful in correlations? 3.4.2.8 Step 6: Check the assumptions Variable types QUESTION 5: What are the variable types for the implicit (IAT_RT) and the explicit (VapingQuestionnaireScore) attitude variables? Missing data TASK: Remove participants with missing data. HINT: Use the filter() function and the is.na() function QUESTION 6: How many people had missing data? Normality TASK: Create histograms and qq-plots for the IAT_RT and VapingQuestionnaireScore variables. HINT: Use the ggplot() function with geom_histogram() and use the qqPlot() function (note the capital P) QUESTION 7: What do you conclude from the histograms and the qq-plots? Are the VapingQuestionnaireScore and the IAT_RT normally distributed? Linearity and homoscedasticity TASK: Plot the relationship between IAT_RT and VapingQuestionnaireScore using a scatterplot and a line of best fit. HINT: For this you’ll need the ggplot() function together with geom_point() and geom_smooth(). Make sure to give your axes some sensible labels. QUESTION 8: What do you conclude from the scatterplot in terms of the homoscedasticity of the data and the linearity, direction and strength of the relationship? What does the scatterplot tell you about possible issues (outliers, range restrictions)? 3.4.2.9 Step 7: Conduct a correlation analysis QUESTION 9: Do you need to calculate Pearson’s r or Spearman’s rho? TASK: Conduct a correlation analysis. HINT: Use the cor.test() function. You may want to use the pull() and the round() functions to get the numbers out. QUESTION 10: Can you write up the results including the r, df, p-value and an interpretation? 3.4.2.10 Step 8: Intercorrelations Finally, let’s check whether either implicit or explicit attitude is associated with age. First, let’s create a new data frame that only includes the relevant variables. Look closely at each line of code below and check you understand what it does. Don’t forget to copy the code below to your script and run it. dat_matrix &lt;- dat %&gt;% select(Age, IAT_RT, VapingQuestionnaireScore) %&gt;% as.data.frame(dat_matrix) # Make sure tell R that dat is a data frame TASK: Now, create a matrix of scatterplots. HINT: Use the pairs() function. QUESTION 11: What do you conclude from the scatterplots? TASK: Finally, conduct intercorrelation (multiple correlations). HINT: Use the correlate() function. Do you need Pearson’s r or Spearman’s rho? Have you adjusted for multiple comparisons? QUESTION 12: What do you conclude from the results of the correlation analysis? 3.5 Answers When you have completed all of the lab content, you may want to check your answers with our completed version of the script for this week. Remember, looking at this script (studying/revising it) does not replace the process of working through the lab activities, trying them out for yourself, getting stuck, asking questions, finding solutions, adding your own comments, etc. Actively engaging with the material is the way to learn these analysis skills, not by looking at someone else’s completed code… The answers to the questions and the script containing the code will be available after the final lab session has taken place.

Chapter 12 provides an accessible overview of simple regression. 4.3 Pre-lab activities After having watched the lectures and read the textbook chapter you’ll be in a good position to try these activities. Completing them before you attend your lab session will help you to consolidate your learning and help move through the lab activities more smoothly. 4.3.1 Pre-lab activity 1: Visualising the regression line Have a look at this visualisation of the regression line by Ryan Safner. In this shiny app, you see a randomly-generated set of data points (within specific parameters, to keep the graph scaled properly). You can choose a slope and intercept for the regression line by using the sliders. The graph also displays the residuals as dashed red lines. Moving the slope or the intercept too much causes the generated line to create much larger residuals. The shiny app also calculates the sum of squared errors (SSE) and the standard error of the regression (SER), which calculates the average size of the error (the red numbers). These numbers reflect how well the regression line fits the data, but you don’t need to worry about those for now. In the app he uses the equation Y = aX + b in which b is the intercept and a is the slope. This is slightly different from the equation you saw during the lecture. There we talked about Y = b0 + b1*X + e. Same equation, just different letters. So b0 in the lecture is equivalent to b in the app and b1 in the lecture is equivalent to a in the app. Pre-lab activity questions: Change the slider for the intercept. How does it change the regression line? Change the slider for the slope. How does it change the regression line? What happens to the residuals (the red dashed lines) when you change the slope and the intercept of the regression line? 4.3.2 Pre-lab activity 2: Data visualisation - practice with ggplot2() In this week’s online tutorials, you will practise visualing data. If you’re ready to begin, go to the tutorial linked to below. There is no need to install or download anything. Each tutorial has everything you need to write and run R code, right in the tutorial. Visualization basics Practise the basics of how to create a graph, how to add variables and how to make different types of graphs. Scatterplots This tutorial revisits scatterplots. Along the way, you will learn to build multi-layer plots and to use new coordinate systems. 4.3.3 Pre-lab activity 3: Getting ready for the lab class 4.3.3.1 Get your files ready Download the 122_week13_forStudents.zip file and upload it into the new folder in RStudio Server you created (see week 12 Pre-lab activity 4 for instructions on how to do that).

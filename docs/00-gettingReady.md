# Step-by-step guide to getting ready

> Written by Margriet Groen 

Before you can start to engage with the statistics content and their implementation in R, you need to make sure you have a clean session in RStudio set up, with relevant files in a folder that RStudio knows about

## Logging into RStudio
Navigate to 
## Creating a project
[Click here for the instructions](https://tombeesley.github.io/PSYC121_2021-22/week-6-visualising-data-and-binomial-tests.html#creating_project) from Week 6 of PSYC121 if you are unsure.

If you need them, [here are the instructions](https://tombeesley.github.io/PSYC121_2021-22/week-2-descriptive-statistics-in-r-studio.html#uploading_zip) from Week 2 of PSYC121.

## Uploading files
Download the relevant files to your computer. We'll specify in the pre-lab activities which files you will need to engage with the lab activities for a particular week. All files will be contained in a zip-folder.

## Loading packages

## Opening a script

## Reading in the data

You might want to re-watch some of the videos John and Tom provided in PSYC121:

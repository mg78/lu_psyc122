<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Week 11: Correlation</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Written by Margriet Groen (partly adapted from materials developed by the PsyTeachR team a the University of Glasgow)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today we will take a look at correlation as a measure of association between two numerical variables. We will create scatterplots to visualise correlations, we will run a correlation analysis and we will practise interpreting and reporting the results.</p>
<div id="lectures" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Lectures</h2>
<p>The lecture material for this week is presented in two parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><a href="https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/6cff8539-a25a-43b7-9647-403f14539276"><strong>Theory</strong></a>

Watch this part either after the ‘Theory’ part of after you’ve completed the pre-lab activities 1 to 3. Definitely watch it before you come to your lab session.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="reading" class="section level2" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Reading</h2>
<p>The reading that accompanies the lectures this week and next week is from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1fyuTuvj3YoaFdUR3FZaXNuNXc/view"><strong>the free textbook by Miller and Haden</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 10</strong> gives you a brief overview of what correlation and regression are. <strong>Chapter 11</strong> introduces correlation in more detail. Both chapters are really short but provide a good basis to understanding correlational analysis. Please note, in Chapter 10 you might encounter some terminology that is unfamiliar to you. It talks about ANOVA, which means Analysis of Variance and about GLM, which means General Linear Model. Having a quick look at Chapter 1 of Miller and Haden also helps with that.</p>
</div>
<div id="pre-lab-activities" class="section level2" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Pre-lab activities</h2>
<p>After having watched the lectures on correlation and read the textbook chapters you’ll be in a good position to try these activities. Completing them before you attend your lab session will help you to consolidate your learning and help move through the lab activities more smoothly.</p>
<div id="pre-lab-activity-1-visualing-correlations" class="section level3" number="2.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Pre-lab activity 1: Visualing correlations</h3>
<p>Have a look at <a href="https://rpsychologist.com/correlation/"><strong>this visualisation of correlations</strong></a> by Kristoffer Magnusson.</p>
<p>After having read Miller and Haden Chapter 11, use this visualisation page to visually replicate the scatterplots in Figures 11.3 and 11.4 - use a sample of 100. After that, visually replicate the scatterplots in Figure 11.5.</p>
<p>Each time you change the correlation, pay attention to the shared variance (the overlap between the two variables) and see how this changes with the changing level of relationship between the two variables. The greater the shared variance, the stronger the relationship.
Also, try setting the correlation to r = .5 and then moving a single dot to see how one data point, a potential outlier, can change the stated correlation value between two variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="pre-lab-activity-2-guess-the-correlation" class="section level3" number="2.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Pre-lab activity 2: Guess the correlation</h3>
<p>Now that you are well versed in interpreting scatterplots (scattergrams) have a go at <a href="https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/GuessCorrelation.html"><strong>this online app on guessing the correlation</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This is a very basic app that allows you to see how good you are at recognising different correlation strengths from the scatterplots. We would recommend you click the “Track Performance” tab so you can keep an overview of your overall bias to underestimate or overestimate a correlation.</p>
<p>Is this all just a bit of fun? Well, yes, because stats is actually fun, and no, because it serves a purpose of helping you determine if the correlations you see in your own data are real, and to help you see if correlations in published research match with what you are being told. As you will have seen from the above examples, one data point can lead to a misleading relationship and even what might be considered a medium to strong relationship may actually have only limited relevance in the real world. One only needs to mention Anscombe’s Quartet to be reminded of the importance of visualising your data, which leads us to the final pre-lab activity for this week.</p>
</div>
<div id="pre-lab-activity-3-anscombes-quartet" class="section level3" number="2.3.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> Pre-lab activity 3: Anscombe’s quartet</h3>
<p>Anscombe (1973) showed that four sets of bivariate data (X, Y) that have the exact same means, medians, and relationships can look very different when plotted. You can read more about this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>All in this is a clear example of why you should visualise your data and not to rely on just the numbers.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2</span> Lab activity 2: Visualising, calculating and reporting correlations</h3>
<p>Going back to the data discussed in Chapter 11 of Miller &amp; Haden, you’ll remember it contains data from 25 8-year-old children on:</p>
<ul>
<li>a standardised test of reading ability (Abil)</li>
<li>intelligence (IQ)</li>
<li>the number of minutes per week spent reading in the home (Home)</li>
<li>and the number of minutes per week spent watching TV (TV)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the video on ‘How to conduct correlation analysis using R’ we looked at the correlation between reading ability and intelligence. Now, let’s look at the correlation between number of minutes per week spent reading in the home and watching TV.</p>
<p>The folder you were asked to download under ‘Pre-lab activity 4: Getting ready for the lab class’ contains the datafile (“MillerHadenData.csv”) as well as the R-script from the ‘How to …’ video (122_wk11_howtoExample.R) that you can use here and adapt.</p>

<p>Researchers were interested in the relationship between hazardous alcohol use and impulsivity (making unplanned, rapid decisions without thinking or ‘acting on a whim’). To investigate the relationship, 20 participants completed both the alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT; Saunders, Aasland, Babor, de la Fuente, &amp; Grant, 1993) and the Barratt’s Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) (Patton, Stanford, &amp; Barratt, 1995).

<p>When you have completed all of the lab content, you may want to check your answers with our completed version of the script for this week. <strong>Remember</strong>, looking at this script (studying/revising it) does not replace the process of working through the lab activities, trying them out for yourself, getting stuck, asking questions, finding solutions, adding your own comments, etc. <strong>Actively engaging</strong> with the material is the way to learn these analysis skills, not by looking at someone else’s completed code…</p>
<!-- The answers to the questions and the script containing the code will be available after the final lab session has taken place. -->

<li><p>FALSE Explanation: The correlation coefficient is negative and therefore infers a negative correlation. As such, older people pay less for car insurance: as age increases, car insurance costs decrease.</p></li>
<li><p>FALSE Explanation: This is a bit of trick question as it has the sneaky ‘cause’ word in. The correlation coefficient is a positive number, suggesting a positive relationship between length of time in prison and aggression. However, causation cannot be inferred from correlation and therefore we cannot know whether time spent in prison CAUSES aggression, and rather we suggest a relationship between the two that as length of time in prison increases, aggression increases.</p></li>
<li><p>c 49% The ‘coefficient of determination’ or ‘R-squared’ tells us the proportion or variance in one variable that can be predicted if we know the other variable. We can determine this by squaring the <em>r</em>. Therefore, .7<sup>2</sup> = .49, <em>R<sup>2</sup></em> = .49.</p></li>

12. Give three logically possible directions of causality, indicating for each direction whether it is a plausible explanation in light of the variables involved (and why). No, this is not a trick question -—I know that correlation does not infer causation, but think critically! New studies/ideas are constructed by thinking what the previous study doesn’t tell us about what could be happening with the variables of interest.</p>
<p><strong>Just really looking for reasoning here.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Being more impulsive may make people consume more alcohol.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Consuming more alcohol may make people more impulsive.</strong></li>
<li><strong>An outgoing personality might influence both your level of impulsivity and you are more likely to be socialising in the pub and consuming alcohol. So the same ‘third factor’ may influence both our variables of interest.</strong></li>
</ul>

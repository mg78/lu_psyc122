# Intro

This is a collection of tuition material written for Psychology undergraduates at Lancaster University. At the moment the content represents the “lab materials” for the PSYC122 module in first year. As was the case for PSYC121, they feature tuition of programming with R, building on the skills you developed last term.

## Analysis labs and 'pre-lab work'
Some parts should be completed before you attend the lab session (watching lectures, reading chapters, pre-lab activities). All the links to the different materials and activities are also in the ‘to-do list’ for the relevant week on Moodle.
